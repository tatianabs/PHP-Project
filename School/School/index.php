                At Education Schoolrrrr, students learn by doing.

Teachers guide students from instruction to action, helping them tackle projects that mirror on-the-job challenges as they develop the knowledge and skill necessary to secure industry credentials, earn college credit or both. For example, marketing students manage a store on their way to earning National Retail Federation certification. ESâ€™s programs fall into five areas of study:
Programming, Networking, WEB Designer and Engineering.
Students may choose to attend ES for a half or full day. Half-day students spend their mornings or afternoons at ES and the remainder of the day taking academic courses at their sending high schools. Full-day students take both their technical and academic courses at ES. View the essential skill alignment chart for each of our programs, as well as our program applications.
